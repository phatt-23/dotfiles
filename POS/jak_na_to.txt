1. Nejdrive nakonfigurovat vsechny porty routeru:

int fa0/0
ip address 205.239.192.254 255.255.255.0
no sh
int fa0/1
ip address 205.239.193.62 255.255.255.192
no sh

a nastavíme DHCP pool:

dhcp pool T
network 205.239.192.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 205.239.193.254

dhcp pool N
network 205.239.193.0 255.255.255.192
default-router dhcp 205.239.193.62

Pak v GUI nakliknout DHCP a mìlo by se to nastavit samo

    100 is access-list for segment T -> out direction

    102 is access-list for segment S -> out direction

)

2.1) Stations on segment T can telnet to a router marked Telnet 
   (IP address 40.0.0.11).

    access-list 100 permit tcp 205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255 30.0.0.10 0.0.0.0 eq 23

2.2) Stations on segment N must not access WWW server 30.0.0.10, 
   the rest of the company's network may connect to any WWW server 
   on Internet.

    -- for the stations in segment N, accessing of WWW server (30.0.0.10) is denied
    access-list 102 deny tcp 205.239.193.0  0.0.0.239   30.0.0.10   0.0.0.0     eq 80

    -- this would cause future headache, its better to be more specific
    access-list 102 deny tcp any host 30.0.0.10 eq 80

2.3) DNS queries to the Internet can and their responses are freely sent forwarded.
   DNS queries from the outside are permitted only to the company's DNS server 
   which sends replies to them.

    -- allow stations in segment T to DNS query 
    -- by forwarding to the DNS server (ip address 50.0.0.12)

    -- established says that the DNS server can only reply, not process new requests.
    access-list 103 permit tcp 50.0.0.12 0.0.0.255 eq 53    205.239.193.0   0.0.0.239 established

2.4) The stations and router of the company's network may ping 
   (ICMP echo request) the hosts on the Internet, 
   but you don't want to endanger your corporate network 
   by potential ping floods from the Internet 
   (with the exception of the corporate DNS server 
    that has to respond to pings from the Internet). 
   The hosts on the Internet may also ping the external 
   interface of R1 router.

    -- allow stations from segment T to ping the Internet
    access-list 100 permit  icmp    205.239.192.0   0.0.0.255   any     echo
    access-list 100 permit  icmp    205.239.192.0   0.0.0.255   any     echo

    -- allow replies to propagate into the network (both segments)
    access-list 101 permit icmp     any     205.239.192.0   0.0.0.255   echo-reply
    access-list 103 permit icmp     any     205.239.193.0   0.0.0.239   echo-reply
