The R1-ISP segment and the Internet services have been pre-configured (including routing).
Services presented in the topology in provider's network are running and responding to
the requests (WWW, Telnet, DNS) and corresponding DNS records exist on provider's DNS server.
(e.g. www.isp.cz).

The company's DNS server will be statically configured on PC1 in the DNS segment.

1. Computers
-   Configure IPv4 addresses for all computers that are statically configured.
    (last usable addresses)

PC1 will set as company's DNS server:
ip address: 205.239.192.254
mask:       255.255.255.0
default:    205.239.192.1

-   Configure IPv4 addresses on interfaces of the router R1 and add descriptions.
    (first usable addresses)

interface Fa0/0
no shutdown
ip address 205.239.192.1 255.255.255.0
description "Segment T"

interface Fa0/1
no shutdown
ip address 205.239.193.1 255.255.255.192
description "Segment N"


2. Router R1 (DHCP)
-   Configure the DHCP server, which will dynamically assign parameters required 
    by the stations (including the provider's DNS server address).
-   Don't use IP addresses whch are already statically assigned on the segment.

ip dhcp excluded-address 205.239.192.1
ip dhcp excluded-address 205.239.193.1
ip dhcp excluded-address 205.239.192.254

ip dhcp pool Pool_Segment_T
network 205.239.192.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 205.239.192.1
dns-server 50.0.0.12

ip dhcp pool Pool_Segment_N
network 205.239.193.0 255.255.255.192
default-router 205.239.193.1
dns-server 50.0.0.12

3. Router R1 (ACL)
-   Implement ACLs on R1's interface leading to the router ISP for both directions.

ip access-list extended "R1_Out"
ip access-list extended "R1_In"

int Se0/0/0
no shutdown
description "ISP"
ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
ip access-group "R1_Out" out
ip access-group "R2_In" in

-   Stations on segment T can Telnet to a router marked Telnet (IP address 40.0.0.11).

ip access-list extended "R1_Out"
permit tcp  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  host 40.0.0.11 eq telnet

ip access-list extended "R1_In"
permit tcp  host 40.0.0.11 eq telnet  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  established 

-   Stations on segment N must not access WWW server 30.0.0.10, 
    the rest of the company's network may connect to any WWW server on the Internet.

ip access-list extended "R1_Out"
deny tcp  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.63  host 30.0.0.10 eq www

-   DNS queries to the Internet and their responses are freely sent.

ip access-list extended "R1_Out"
permit tcp  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  any eq domain
permit udp  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  any eq domain

ip access-list extended "R1_In"
permit tcp  any eq domain  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  established 
permit udp  any eq domain  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  

-   DNS queries from the outside are permitted only to the company's DNS server
    which sends back replies.

ip access-group extended "R1_Out"
permit tcp  host 205.239.192.254 eq domain  any  established
permit udp  host 205.239.192.254 eq domain  any

ip access-group extended "R1_In"
permit tcp  any  host 205.239.192.254 eq domain
permit udp  any  host 205.239.192.254 eq domain

-   The stations and routers of the company's network may ping (ICMP echo request)
    the hosts on the Internet, but you don't want to endanger your corporate network 
    by potential ping floods from the Internet. 

ip access-group extended "R1_Out"
permit icmp  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  any  echo

ip access-group extended "R1_In"
permit icmp  any  205.239.192.0 0.0.0.255  echo-reply

-   The exception being the company's DNS server that has to respond to the pings 
    from the Internet. 

ip access-group extended "R1_Out"
permit icmp  host 205.239.192.254  any  echo-reply

ip access-group extended "R1_In"
permit icmp  any  host 205.239.192.254  echo

-   The hosts on the Internet may also ping the external interface of R1 router.

ip access-group extended "R1_Out"
permit icmp  host 10.0.0.2  any  echo

ip access-group extended "R1_In"
permit icmp  any  host 10.0.0.2  echo-reply
